        "Overcome": "Cinderella uses her mini-pumpkin-oil-powered magnifying glass (a gadget she built) to focus the sunlight onto a specific cluster of berries. The heat causes the berries to release a concentrated burst of their sweet scent, attracting a shy Flutterwing from its hiding place.",
        "SequenceEvents": "First [Hook: A Flutterwing's shimmering dust settles on a patch of unusually large berries, catching Alice's eye.]... | Then [Action: Alice, noting the berries in her book, tries to reach them, but they are just out of reach, nestled among thorny vines.]... | Next [Twist: Cinderella notices the Flutterwing is hesitant, as if guarding something.]... | Finally [Resolution: Cinderella uses her pumpkin-oil magnifying glass to release the berries' scent, attracting the Flutterwing closer. It reveals a tiny, lost button from Cinderella's dress, which Alice then carefully returns, earning the Flutterwing's trust. The Flutterwing then leads them to an even bigger patch of berries.]"
