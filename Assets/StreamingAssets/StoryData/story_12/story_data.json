Cinderella, meticulously checking her pumpkin-powered berry-picker, notices a strange energy reading near a cluster of bushes. Peter, bored, starts doing loop-de-loops around the patch in his plane. | Next [Twist]... Cinderella's instruments go haywire as she approaches the bushes; Peter's plane sputters and stalls near the same spot. They discover a thick layer of leaves is causing the interference. | Finally [Resolution]... Peter uses his plane's propeller to blow the leaves away, revealing a hidden, moss-covered doorway leading to a glowing grove filled with oversized, luminous berries."
